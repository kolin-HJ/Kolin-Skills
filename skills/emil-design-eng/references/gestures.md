# Gesture and drag interactions

## Gesture and Drag Interactions

### Momentum-based dismissal

Don't require dragging past a threshold. Calculate velocity: `Math.abs(dragDistance) / elapsedTime`. If velocity exceeds ~0.11, dismiss regardless of distance. A quick flick should be enough.

```js
const timeTaken = new Date().getTime() - dragStartTime.current.getTime();
const velocity = Math.abs(swipeAmount) / timeTaken;

if (Math.abs(swipeAmount) >= SWIPE_THRESHOLD || velocity > 0.11) {
  dismiss();
}
```

### Damping and friction at boundaries

When a user drags past the natural boundary (e.g., dragging a drawer up when already at top), allow the drag with increasing friction: the more they drag, the less the element moves. Do not stop it at a hard wall.

### Pointer capture for drag

Once dragging starts, set the element to capture all pointer events. This ensures dragging continues even if the pointer leaves the element bounds.

### Multi-touch protection

Ignore additional touch points after the initial drag begins. Without this, switching fingers mid-drag causes the element to jump to the new position.

```js
function onPress() {
  if (isDragging) return;
  // Start drag...
}
```
