# Viewport and layout fixes

### 3. Layout has the wrong height

`100vh` on mobile is the *largest* viewport — the height with the browser chrome collapsed. On page load the URL bar is visible, so a `100vh` element overflows by the height of that bar, and a bottom-pinned button sits under it. Use the dynamic and small units instead:

```css
/* App shell, drawers, anything that should track the visible area as chrome shows/hides */
.app { height: 100dvh; }

/* Heroes and first screens — the smallest the viewport gets, so nothing is ever cut off */
.hero { min-height: 100svh; }
```

`dvh` resizes as the URL bar collapses, which is right for an app shell but causes layout shifts on marketing content mid-scroll. `svh` is stable and never overflows, which is right for a hero. `lvh` is the old `vh` — you almost never want it. Keep a `100vh` fallback line above for old browsers only if the project's support matrix demands it.

### 4. Page zooms into the input

iOS Safari zooms the page when focus lands on an input whose font size is under 16px, and it does not zoom back out on blur. The user is left looking at a cropped, drifted layout. This is the reason people reach for `maximum-scale=1`, which is the wrong fix (Hard Rule 4).

```css
input, textarea, select {
  font-size: 16px; /* the minimum; 1rem at the default root size */
}
```

If the design calls for smaller text in inputs on desktop, scale it up only where it matters:

```css
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  input, textarea, select { font-size: 16px; }
}
```

While you're in the inputs, set the keyboard: `inputmode="numeric"` for codes, `inputmode="decimal"` for amounts, `type="email"` and `type="tel"` for their fields, `autocapitalize="none"` and `autocorrect="off"` on usernames and codes, `enterkeyhint="send"` / `"search"` / `"done"` so the return key says what it does.

### 7. Content stops at the notch

By default the browser letterboxes your page inside the safe area, leaving the notch, Dynamic Island, and home-indicator zones the body's background color. A native app paints edge to edge and pads its *content* away from those zones. Two steps:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

```css
.app-header {
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
}
.bottom-bar {
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
}
.sheet {
  padding-bottom: calc(1rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
}
```

`viewport-fit=cover` lets the page under the notch; `env(safe-area-inset-*)` gives you the insets to pad back out. Without the meta tag the `env()` values are all `0px`. Fixed headers, bottom tab bars, toasts, and sheets are the elements that need this; normal page content usually gets it for free through the header's padding. Give `env()` a fallback (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)`) when the value is used in a calc.
