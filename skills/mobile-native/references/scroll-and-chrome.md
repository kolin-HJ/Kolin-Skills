# Scroll and browser chrome fixes

### 6. Pull-to-refresh hijacks scroll

Scrolling past the top of the page triggers pull-to-refresh on Android Chrome and the whole-page rubber band on iOS. Fine on a document. Wrong in an app with its own scroll containers, a drawer the user drags down, or a canvas.

```css
html, body {
  overscroll-behavior: none;
}
```

Then, on any inner scrollable — a sheet's content, a chat list, a sidebar — stop scroll from chaining to the page when it hits the end:

```css
.sheet-content {
  overflow-y: auto;
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}
```

`contain` keeps the container's own bounce (which feels native) but stops the page behind it from moving. Use `none` on the root, `contain` on children. Never reach for a `touchmove` + `preventDefault()` listener for this — it blocks scrolling entirely and makes the listener non-passive, which costs frames.

### 10. Status bar color doesn't match

The status bar and the browser chrome take their color from `theme-color`. One value means light mode gets a dark bar or dark mode gets a white one. Give each scheme its own:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff" />
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#0a0a0a" />
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
```

Match the value to the color at the very top of your page — the header background, not the brand color. In Next.js set it through the `viewport` export (`themeColor: [{ media, color }]`). If the app switches theme with a class rather than the OS setting, update the tag from JavaScript on toggle. For an installed PWA, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` and the manifest's `theme_color`/`background_color` are the same decision.
